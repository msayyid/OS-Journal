## Project Overview

This technical journal documents the configuration, security hardening, monitoring, and performance evaluation of a Linux-based operating system. The coursework follows a structured, week-by-week approach aligned with industry-standard system administration practices.

A dual-system architecture was used, consisting of a headless Linux server accessed exclusively via SSH from a separate workstation. Throughout the coursework, security controls were implemented, performance metrics were collected, and system behaviour was analysed under different workloads.

---

## System Architecture Summary

- **Server System:** Ubuntu Linux (headless, SSH-only access)
- **Workstation System:** Fedora Linux (SSH client and monitoring tools)
- **Virtualisation Platform:** Oracle VirtualBox
- **Network Model:** VM-to-VM virtual network with firewall-controlled access
